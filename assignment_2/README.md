This is an assignment for feature extraction.

Task 1 : Generate data samples which are randomly distributed on 3 co-centric spheres in 3D space with centre at (1,1,1) and radius with 1,2 and 3 respectively.  Plot a 3D plot of them use 3 different colours  to the points one 3 different spheres. 

Task2 : Find 2D presentation of these samples using Linear PCA, LDA (use colours as there class labels), PCA with polynomial kernel with degree 5 and PCA with Gaussian kernel. Please write a report with all four 2D plots and write your observation  about them. Please select width of the gaussian kernel appropriately so that samples from 3 classes become well separated from each other in their 2D projection.
